# 💭 Second Thought - Hackathon Submission

## Project Overview

**Second Thought** is an AI-powered browser extension that intervenes at the critical moment of impulse purchases, helping users build long-term wealth by making more conscious spending decisions.

### The Problem

Americans lose an average of $18,000 annually to impulse purchases. E-commerce platforms use sophisticated psychological tactics—fake urgency, manipulative discounts, and frictionless checkout—to exploit our cognitive biases. The result? Drained savings, mounting debt, and missed opportunities for wealth building.

### Our Solution

Second Thought acts as a financial guardian that:
1. **Intercepts** checkout attempts on major e-commerce sites
2. **Analyzes** the purchase using AI to detect necessity vs. impulse
3. **Reveals** the true opportunity cost (what that money could become if invested)
4. **Protects** users with a 24-hour cool-down period for non-essential purchases
5. **Educates** users about predatory pricing tactics in real-time

## What We Built

### Core Features

#### 1. Real-Time Purchase Intervention
- Content script detects product pages across major e-commerce platforms
- Extracts product details (name, price, description, images)
- Injects a non-intrusive intervention panel before checkout
- Works on Amazon, eBay, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Etsy, and Shopify stores

#### 2. AI-Powered Purchase Analysis
- Uses **Google Gemini 3** with the `gemini-3-flash-preview` model
- Analyzes purchase necessity based on user's financial profile
- Provides personalized, empathetic guidance (not judgmental)
- Detects emotional triggers and suggests alternatives

#### 3. Opportunity Cost Calculator
- Shows what the purchase amount could grow to if invested
- Calculates projections at 5, 10, and 20 years (7% annual return)
- Makes abstract financial concepts tangible and immediate
- Example: $200 impulse buy = $774 in 20 years

#### 4. Predatory Pricing Detection
- Identifies fake discounts (inflated original prices)
- Detects urgency manipulation ("Only 2 left!", countdown timers)
- Flags scarcity tactics and FOMO triggers
- Educates users about psychological manipulation

#### 5. Cool-Down System
- Enforces 24-hour waiting period for non-essential purchases
- Sends reminder notifications when cool-down expires
- Tracks cool-down history in Supabase
- Reduces impulse purchases by introducing friction

#### 6. User Profile & Personalization
- Stores financial goals, income, and savings targets
- Personalizes AI analysis based on user context
- Tracks engagement metrics (interventions, purchases prevented)
- Privacy-first: all data stored securely in Supabase

## Hackathon Categories

### 1. Best Use of Opik ($5,000)

We've implemented comprehensive observability using Opik:

#### Request Tracing
Every AI analysis is fully traced:
```typescript
const trace = opik.trace({
  name: "purchase-analysis",
  input: { product, userProfile },
  metadata: { userId, productId, price }
});
```

#### LLM-as-Judge Evaluations
Three custom metrics evaluate every AI response:
- **Empathy Score**: Is the guidance supportive and non-judgmental?
- **Accuracy Score**: Are the financial calculations correct?
- **Actionability Score**: Does it provide clear next steps?

#### Experiment Tracking
We track prompt variations to optimize AI quality:
- Baseline prompt vs. empathy-enhanced prompt
- Short-form vs. detailed analysis
- Different temperature settings

#### User Engagement Metrics
Track real-world impact:
- Interventions triggered
- Purchases prevented
- Cool-downs activated
- Money saved (estimated)

### 2. Financial Health ($5,000)

Second Thought directly addresses financial wellness:

#### Wealth Building
- Visualizes opportunity cost of every purchase
- Shows compound growth over 5, 10, 20 years
- Makes investing tangible and immediate

#### Consumer Protection
- Exposes predatory pricing tactics
- Educates about psychological manipulation
- Empowers informed decision-making

#### Behavioral Change
- 24-hour cool-down reduces impulse purchases
- Personalized guidance builds financial literacy
- Positive reinforcement for good decisions

#### Measurable Impact
Based on research, if Second Thought prevents just 10% of impulse purchases:
- Average user saves: $1,800/year
- 20-year investment value: $73,800 (at 7% return)
- Lifetime wealth impact: $100,000+

## Technical Highlights

### 1. Load-Balanced AI Inference
```typescript
// Fast inference with Gemini 3
const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
  model: "gemini-3-flash-preview",
  contents: prompt,
});
```

### 2. Property-Based Testing
```typescript
// Test opportunity cost calculations with random inputs
fc.assert(
  fc.property(
    fc.float({ min: 0.01, max: 10000 }),
    fc.integer({ min: 1, max: 50 }),
    (amount, years) => {
      const result = calculateOpportunityCost(amount, years);
      return result >= amount; // Should always grow
    }
  )
);
```

### 3. Real-Time Product Extraction
```typescript
// Extract product details from any e-commerce site
function extractProductInfo() {
  const selectors = {
    amazon: { price: '#priceblock_ourprice', title: '#productTitle' },
    ebay: { price: '.x-price-primary', title: '.x-item-title' },
    // ... more sites
  };
  // Intelligent fallback logic
}
```

### 4. Opik Integration
```typescript
// Full observability for every request
const span = trace.span({
  name: "ai-analysis",
  input: { prompt, model: "qwen-3-235b" }
});

const result = await analyzeProduct(product);

span.end({
  output: result,
  metadata: { tokens: result.usage.total_tokens }
});

// LLM-as-judge evaluation
await evaluateResponse(result, {
  empathy: true,
  accuracy: true,
  actionability: true
});
```

## Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Impulse Electronics Purchase
1. User browses Amazon for a $300 smartwatch
2. Second Thought intervenes with:
   - AI analysis: "This seems like a want, not a need"
   - Opportunity cost: $1,161 in 20 years
   - Predatory tactic detected: "Fake urgency (Only 3 left!)"
   - 24-hour cool-down activated
3. User reflects, realizes they don't need it
4. $300 saved → invested → $1,161 in future wealth

### Scenario 2: Legitimate Purchase
1. User needs to buy work shoes ($80)
2. Second Thought analyzes:
   - AI recognizes necessity based on user profile
   - Shows opportunity cost but doesn't block
   - Suggests checking for better deals
3. User proceeds with informed decision

### Scenario 3: Predatory Pricing Detection
1. User finds "70% off" deal on clothing
2. Second Thought reveals:
   - Original price was inflated (fake discount)
   - Urgency timer is manipulative
   - Actual value is questionable
3. User avoids scam, saves money

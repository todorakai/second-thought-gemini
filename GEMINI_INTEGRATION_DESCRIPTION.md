# Gemini 3 Integration Description (200 words)

## For Hackathon Submission

Second Thought leverages **Gemini 3's enhanced reasoning capabilities** to analyze impulse purchases in real-time and provide personalized financial guidance. The integration uses the `gemini-3-flash-preview` model to deliver sub-second analysis of product pages, detecting predatory pricing tactics, calculating opportunity costs, and generating empathetic, context-aware recommendations.

**Gemini 3 is central to the application in four key ways:**

**1. Real-Time Purchase Analysis**: Gemini 3 processes product information (name, price, urgency indicators) along with user financial goals to determine if a purchase is essential or impulsive. The model's enhanced reasoning allows it to understand nuanced contexts—distinguishing between "work shoes" (essential) and "designer sneakers" (impulse).

**2. Predatory Pricing Detection**: Gemini 3 analyzes pricing patterns and urgency language to identify manipulation tactics like fake discounts and artificial scarcity. Its advanced understanding helps detect subtle psychological triggers in product descriptions.

**3. Personalized Financial Guidance**: The model generates empathetic, non-judgmental messages tailored to each user's financial goals (e.g., "saving for a house"). Gemini 3's language capabilities ensure responses feel supportive rather than preachy.

**4. Structured JSON Output**: Gemini 3 reliably returns structured data (essentiality scores, warnings, suggested actions) that drives the intervention UI, thanks to its improved instruction-following capabilities.

The low latency of Gemini 3 Flash makes real-time intervention possible—users don't notice any delay, maintaining a seamless shopping experience while gaining financial insights.
